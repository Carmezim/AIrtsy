Working implementation in TensorFlow of [**A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style**](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) based on [here](http://www.chioka.in/tensorflow-implementation-neural-algorithm-of-artistic-style).

The code had to be modified as comparing to the source because some parameters were unmatching the model layers.
