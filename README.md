Working implementation in TensorFlow of (http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)[*A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style*] based on this (http://www.chioka.in/tensorflow-implementation-neural-algorithm-of-artistic-style)[tutorial].

The code had to be modified as comparing to the source because some parameters were unmatching the model layers.
