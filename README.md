Working implementation in TensorFlow of [**A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style**](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) based on this [tutorial](http://www.chioka.in/tensorflow-implementation-neural-algorithm-of-artistic-style).

The code had to be modified as comparing to the source because some parameters were unmatching the model layers.

##Requirements:

Dependencies:
* TensorFlow
* Scipy
* Numpy
* Jupyter Notebook

Download the [VGG-19 model](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat).
